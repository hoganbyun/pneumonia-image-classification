# Pneumonia X-ray Image Classification

Author: Hogan Byun

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train a neural network to identify whether a patient has pneumonia based on his/her chest x-ray. This project utilized neural networks and convolutional neural networks, ultimately opting for the latter as they are more well-suited for image classification tasks.

## Data

All the data has been curated from Kaggle. The original dataset is provided by Kermany et al.: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/pediatric-pneumonia-chest-xray

The data contains 5,856 total chest x-rays, of which, 4,273 are of pneumonia and 1583 are healthy. 

## Methods

As stated earlier, this project uses (convolutional) neural netoworks to classify images while following the OSEMN data science process.
